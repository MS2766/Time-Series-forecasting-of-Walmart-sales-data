# Retail Demand Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
Retail demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory management and reducing costs. This project utilizes historical sales data from multiple stores to build a predictive model that forecasts future sales. The dataset includes various features such as store characteristics, promotional markdowns, and economic factors.


## 📂 Dataset Description
The project leverages three main datasets:
- **features.csv**: Contains additional information about stores, including markdowns, CPI, and unemployment rates.
- **stores.csv**: Provides metadata about the stores, such as store type and size.
- **train.csv**: Historical weekly sales data for multiple stores and departments.

Each dataset plays a significant role in understanding demand patterns and improving forecast accuracy.


## 🔧 Installation & Dependencies
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```


## 🚀 Usage Instructions
Follow these steps to use the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-demand-forecast.git
cd retail-demand-forecast
```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook "Retail Demand Forecast (4).ipynb"
```

3. **Execute the cells in the notebook to:**

    - Load and preprocess the data

    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

    - Train a predictive model

    - Evaluate the model's performance


##   📊 Features & Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating additional features to improve predictive accuracy.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing machine learning models such as:

     - Linear Regression

     - Decision Trees

     - Random Forest

     - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

4. **Model Evaluation:** Using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics to assess model performance.


## 📈 Results & Insights
The notebook presents various insights based on the data, including:
- Sales trends over time
- Store-wise demand variations
- The impact of economic factors on sales
